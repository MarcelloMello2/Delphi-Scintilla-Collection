@Delphi Scintilla Interface Components 0.15
@
text
@These components has only been tested with Delphi 7 and C++ Builder 6,
and some work is being done on C++ Builder 5 by Udo.

If you get them to work with other versions of those compilers
then let me know.. I'm interested in the packagefiles you've created,
and/or other adjustments that needed to be done.

Some of these components are inspired and in some parts
inherited from the relatively basic DelphiWrapper v1.4 at
http://www.pnotepad.org/scintilla/
by Simon Steele (ss@@pnotepad.org), and later improved by
(kvlahos@@london.edu).

The TscFontComboBox (by Stefan Cruysberghs http://www.scip.be)
(renamed to TtcFontComboBox) with some fixes etc are used by the
TScintillaOptionsDlg component, and is also exposed on the
componentbar itself.

The ConfirmReplaceDlg and ReplaceTextDlg from the
SynEdit project (http://SynEdit.SourceForge.net) are also used.

These parts are licensed as MPL (Mozilla Public License) or GPL

The rest of the project are released under the LGPL licence and is
