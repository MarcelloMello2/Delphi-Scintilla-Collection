@INSTALLATION OF SCINTILLA COMPONENTS FOR DELPHI

Delphi 7

Open SCITED7.DPK. If a messagebox about TTcFontComboBox not existing appears,
just click cancel. Compile the package the usual way.

Open DCLSCITD7.DPK, and compile it the usual way.

On the menu select Component->Install Packages
Click add, and locate the compiled DCLSCITD7.BPL file
(it's located where your default output path is).
Select the package, and thats it.

C++ Builder 6

See above, but with the filenames SCITE.BPK and DCLSCITE.BPK

OTHER COMPILERS

If you get the packages to compile with another Delphi/C++ Builder
version, give me a message, along with the package source for it.
i.e packagename.bpk,packagename.res,packagename.cpp (C++ Builder) or
packagename.dpk,packagename.cfg,packagename.dof,packagename.res (Delphi).
