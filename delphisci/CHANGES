  15/10/2004 BUGFIX:
             Fixed a bug in GetStyleListStr. Didn't set the LanguageStr when
             nullitm didn't exits, and it was created. Caused
             TScintillaOptionsDlg to throw an exception with list error
             when you tried to add a style and no nullstyles existed.
             (hdalis@users.sourceforge.net)

  17/10/2004 Removed TScintillaBase.LoadSettingsFromStream and TScintillaBase.SaveSettingsToStream, unnessecary now.
             Added property editor for the Lexer property of TSciLangItem
             (hdalis@users.sourceforge.net)

  24/10/2004 Removed the TLexerNamesMap class, and the LexerMapper function
             these are now part of the TSciSynLexer class (functions AddLanguage,
             DupLanguage,RemoveLanguage,FillListWithLanguages)
             (hdalis@users.sourceforge.net)

  25/10/2004 Redesigned the whole OptionsForm. Added add,copy,remove languages buttons.
             Added Active Hotspot options.
             The Keywords page doesn't exist anymore, it is now a part of the
             Highlighter page.
             (hdalis@users.sourceforge.net)

  26/10/2004 Moved the GetLexerMapperProps function to TSciSynLexer.GetLexerProps (ScintillaSynLexer.Pas)
             (hdalis@users.sourceforge.net)

  27/10/2004 Renamed the TSciSynLexer.LanguageStr to SelectedLanguage,
             and the SetLanguageStr to SetSelectedLanguage.
             Renamed TSciLangList.GetStyleListStr to GetStyleList.

             Changed the shortcuts for Paraup/Paradown/Wordpartleft/wordpartright * commands 'cause it didn't work with
             []/\ in all languages. Seemed more logical also.
             removed the commenting of the stuttered commands.. Don't know if these work, but..
             Removed the opKeywords from the TSciOptionPage enum. No longer needed.
             Renamed the opOptions2 to opColors
             Changed the TSciSearchReplace.Editor property from TScintilla to TScintillaBase class.
             Wasn't any need for the extra properties to use this dialog.
             (hdalis@users.sourceforge.net)

  30/10/2004 Added Comment* properties to TSciLangItem, used by
             CommentBox/CommentBlock functions in TScintilla.
             Added CommentBox and CommentBlock functions.
             Added TSciLangSettings definitions for a number of languages.
             Added TSciLangSettings record, and the AddIt function has a new parameter of
             this type to define the commenting style and other things for the languages.
             (hdalis@users.sourceforge.net)

  02/11/2004 Refreshed against version 1.62 of scintilla.iface
             No longer displays a list of all lexers in the OptionsForm, now only defined languages
             are displayed, i.e those defined in the Highlighter.LanguageList.
             If you want to add a language, click Add and set the languagename and
             the lexer to use for it. You can have as many languages defined as you wish.
             Added the Asn1 and Vhdl lexer styles (Scintilla v1.62).
             (hdalis@users.sourceforge.net)

  03/11/2004 Added the protected properties CallTipStartChars and CallTipEndChars to TScintillaAuto.
             Changed the packages to not include the .dcr files in the scite.bpl or scited7.bpl when
             compiled. Wasted diskspace.
             (hdalis@users.sourceforge.net)

  04/11/2004 BUGFIX: When a new keylist was added, and you typed a description then the text
             in the listbox wasn't updated. Fixed.

  07/11/2004 Reintroduced the ExportToHTML function originally found in the DelphiWrapper
             to TScintilla as requested by Kiriakos Vlahos,
             some changes was needed to fit with the new layout of the components.
             a bug in the function was also fixed (didn't use the correct styles,
             was lagging a style behind).
             Made the Lines property published as requested by Kiriakos Vlahos.
             Exposed the OnClick event as Published.
             The SelectedLanguage property is made into a selectionlist of the defined languages,
             no need to remember the languagenames you'd created anymore.
             The TSciLexerPropertyEditor was fixed to get the list of lexers from the FillListWithLanguages
             function in the proper way, instead of creating a temporary TSciSynLexer first.
             BUGS/Features:
             AutoCompleteOps.AStrings wasn't searched when autocompleting,
             changed the code to search AutoCompleteOps.AStrings when AutoCompleteOps.CompleteWord is False.
             (hdalis@users.sourceforge.net)
  08/11/2004 Added ActiveDocument property to TSciDocumentTabControl to make it easier to retrieve
             the saved settings for the currently active document.
  09/11/2004 SelectionFileName added two extra bytes (nullbytes), Fixed.
             A bug was found in RangeIsAllWhiteSpace. It did exactly the opposite
             of what it should do.
             Added EdgeColumn,EdgeType,EdgeColor etc to TSciOptionsDlg
             Some redesign of the Options page to make it fit.. To be adjusted later.
             Moved the CharPos function to SciLexer.Pas. Was needed more places now.
  10/11/2004 CommentBox and CommentStream now takes a boolean parameter 'includecommentcharsinselection'
             that if it's True it selects the commenting strings also, if not then the commenting
             strings are not selected.
  11/11/2004 Added the FlipVars function.
             Removed the IsDirty property. Modified did just the same actually.
             Added per tab hinting for TSciDocumentTabControl. Displays the full pathname of the file when ShowHint is True.
  18/11/2004 Removed the TScintillaAuto component, this is now replaced with TSciAutoComplete.
             Added three new components TSciCallTips, TSciAutoComplete, TSciMacroRecorder.
             Now you can select exactly what predefined languages to add, not just all or nothing.

  26/11/2004 Added the property DefaultExt for setting the default file extension in TSciDocumentTabControl.
             Added calls to the OnDetectHighlighter when we're attached to
             a TScintilla component, and we're attaching ourself.
             Introduced the TSciAbbrevManager component.
  30/11/2004 Added TScintillaDB and TScintillaMemoDB (database components).
